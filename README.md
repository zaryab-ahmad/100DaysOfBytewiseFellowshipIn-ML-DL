# 100DaysOfBytewiseFellowshipIn-ML-DL
I'll continue updating this readme file as I upload more tasks. I'm grateful to be part of this fellowship, where I've found a conducive environment to work and a well-structured roadmap for learning ML (Machine Learning) and DL (Deep Learning). Many thanks to the Bytewise team and our lead for their support and guidance.

Learning from the First Week of the Fellowship

In the inaugural week of the Bytewise Fellowship, I embarked on a comprehensive journey spanning foundational Python skills to advanced algorithms. Here’s a recap of my key learnings:

Python Proficiency:

Strengthened foundational understanding of Python, encompassing syntax, user input/output, type casting, control flow, and manipulation of lists and strings.
Gained confidence in basic coding practices, laying a robust groundwork for more complex tasks ahead.
Intermediate Python Challenges:

Tackled intermediate-level problems such as palindrome identification, Fibonacci sequence generation, prime number detection, and temperature conversions.
Enhanced problem-solving skills and familiarity with advanced Python features, particularly in handling strings and numerical operations.
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):

Delved into fundamental DSA concepts including dynamic programming and applications like Binary Search Trees, merge operations, and palindrome detection in linked lists.
Advanced understanding of algorithmic thinking, breaking down complex problems into manageable parts.
Advanced DSA Topics:

Explored advanced DSA topics like Quick Sort, Knapsack problem solutions, graph traversals (DFS & BFS), Dijkstra’s Algorithm, and finding the Longest Common Subsequence.
Developed proficiency in implementing efficient algorithms and further honed problem-solving methodologies.
Overall Experience:

Found the fellowship environment conducive to learning, with a structured roadmap for progressing through ML/DL concepts.
Grateful to the Bytewise team and our lead for their support and guidance throughout this enriching journey.
This first week provided a solid foundation and set the stage for deeper exploration and mastery in the weeks to come.
